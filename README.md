# Swatch ‚è±Ô∏è

*Just another Stop Watch tool.*

This project started for a friend of mine who was forced to do some time tracking labour only possible in some analog manner. üò¢

It since became a playground project for me learning how to work with localStorage and indexedDB.

All data is stored in your browser, none of your recorded data is transmitted to any server.

Furthermore my motivation was to also reduce number of inputs, so no further text input after creation is allowed and
have as least complexity as possible.

Coding roughly 16h hours now, it supports creation of Swatches: Stopwatches for multiple users in parallel, each can be
ended with a different task (optionally).
You can also have more than just one Swatches.

To get the numbers you simply export your Swatch as CSV and import it into your favorite Office suite.

It's currently in german, so let's get to my TODOs:
- support translations
- implement single user stop watch
- implement installation as browser app
- sharing across devices maybe?
